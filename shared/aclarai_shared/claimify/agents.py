Base agent classes and implementations for the Claimify pipeline.

This module contains the three core agents:
- SelectionAgent: Identifies relevant sentence chunks
- DisambiguationAgent: Rewrites sentences to remove ambiguities
- DecompositionAgent: Breaks sentences into atomic claims

Each agent is designed to accept different LLM instances for future configurability.

Disambiguation guidelines:
1. Replace ambiguous pronouns (it, this, that, they) with specific entities

4. Make temporal and causal relationships explicit

- "It failed." → "[The system] failed."

Analyze the following disambiguated sentence and extract atomic claims that meet the Claimify quality criteria.

Quality Criteria for Claims:

2. SELF-CONTAINED: No ambiguous pronouns or references (all entities clearly identified)  
3. VERIFIABLE: Contains specific, factual information that can be fact-checked

- "In Python, a slice cannot be assigned to a parameter of type int in __setitem__."
- "The error rate increased to 25% after deployment."

Examples of INVALID claims:
- "The error occurred while calling __setitem__ with a slice." (vague reference "the error")
- "The system worked but was slow." (compound statement - not atomic)
- "Something went wrong." (not specific enough to verify)

Instructions:
1. Split compound sentences (connected by "and", "but", "or", "because", etc.)
